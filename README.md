## Description

This is a book search application. When a user loads the application, they are presented with options to search for a book and to login/signup. When a user clicks the "Search for Books" navigation button, they are presented with an input field and a submit button. When the user is not logged in, the search returns results with book titles, authors, descriptions, images, and links to the books on Google Books. When the user clicks the "Login/Signup" navigation button, they are presented a modal with a toggle between login and signup. When signup is selected, the user is presented three inputs for username, email, and password along with a signup button. When login is selected, the user is presented two inputs for email and password along with a login button. When a signup user enters a valid email and password and submits the form, a new account is created and they are logged in. When a login user enters a valid email and password, they are logged in. When a user is logged in, the navigation bar includes a new button for "Saved Books" and replaces the "Login/Signup" button with a "Logout" button. When a user is logged in and submits a book search, the results include book titles, authors, descriptions, images, links to the books on Google Books, and buttons to save the books to the user's saved books. When a user clicks on the "Save Book" button, that book's data is saved to the user's account. When the user clicks on "Saved Books" in the navigation bar, they are presented all of the books they have saved to their account and shown the books' titles, authors, descriptions, images, links to the books on Google Books, and buttons to remove books from the user's saved books. When a user clicks on the "Remove Book" button, that book is deleted from the user's saved books. When a user clicks the "Logout" button, the user is logged out and the navigation bar returns to containing buttons for "Search for Books" and "Login/Signup".
